Threat intelligence is a broad and ever-changing field that deals with identifying and analyzing potential threats to an organization. It is the combination of people, processes, and technologies focused on understanding the risk of digital adversaries – also known as cyberthreats. While we are all familiar with antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, etc., threat intelligence goes far beyond these common controls to identify attackers and their methods in order to help organizations respond appropriately and swiftly.
 Threat intelligence includes various types of analysis from network monitoring, user behavior observation, threat identification services (which involve identifying malware domains), and many more solutions – each with its own strengths. 
This blog will discuss what threat intelligence is, why it’s important for your business, and how you can implement it in your organization.
